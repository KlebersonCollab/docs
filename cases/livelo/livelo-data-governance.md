## 2. Governance Overview

### Governance Objective
Ensure responsible, compliant, and cost-controlled usage of conversational AI and automation data assets across Livelo by defining ownership, access policies, lifecycle management, and monitoring for the N8N + Open WebUI + LiteLLM stack.

### Governance Scope
- **Included Data**: conversational transcripts, workflow execution logs, RAG corpora (documents, embeddings), budget transactions, observability metrics.
- **Excluded Data**: legacy loyalty transactional databases (managed by core loyalty platform), marketing analytics warehouses (governed separately).
- **Governance Period**: 2024-01-01 — ongoing, with quarterly reviews.

### Governance Principles
- **Isolation by Design**: run all AI workloads in a segregated cloud account with controlled ingress/egress.
- **Budget Accountability**: enforce pre-paid quotas per agent owner through LiteLLM.
- **Least Privilege Access**: grant data access only to roles that require it, with VPN + SSO enforcement.
- **Auditability**: maintain full traceability of prompts, outputs, model choices, and token spend.
