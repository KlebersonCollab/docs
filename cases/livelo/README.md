# Livelo AI Automation Knowledge Pack

## Purpose
This knowledge pack consolidates the key insights extracted from the Livelo podcast episode about large-scale automation and AI adoption with N8N and Lovable. It provides architectural views, operational guardrails, governance practices, and actionable use cases so that teams can replicate the approach or benchmark their own initiatives.

## Document Inventory
- `livelo-high-level-architecture.md`: end-to-end architecture describing how Livelo combines Open WebUI, N8N, LiteLLM, multi-cloud models, and Kubernetes to deliver AI-driven automation.
- `livelo-engineering-guidelines.md`: engineering guardrails covering workflow selection, code quality, security, and operational processes for AI agents and automations.
- `livelo-data-governance.md`: governance framework that explains the sandbox account strategy, access controls, compliance measures, and budget management.
- `uc-liv-001-ai-pull-request-reviewer.md`: canonical use case detailing the AI-assisted pull request analysis agent integrated with Git workflows.

## How to Use This Folder
1. **Architecture & Platform Teams** should start with the high-level architecture document to understand component responsibilities and scaling decisions.
2. **Engineering Managers and Tech Leads** can adopt the engineering guidelines to onboard new squads or align existing teams.
3. **Data, Security, and Compliance Officers** should review the data governance plan to validate policies before expanding AI usage.
4. **Product Owners** can reference the use case to prioritise new AI automations and estimate required effort.
